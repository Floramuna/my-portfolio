# My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a space where creativity meets code.

## 🚀 About the Project

This is my very first portfolio, crafted with passion using modern web technologies like **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**. It's a showcase of who I am, the projects I've built, and the journey I’m on as a developer.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Vite** — lightning-fast bundler and dev server
- **React** — for building interactive UIs
- **TypeScript** — adding type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- **shadcn-ui** — for beautiful, accessible components

## ✨ Inspiration

This portfolio is more than just a website — it's a reflection of growth, resilience, and a love for technology. I built it to share my work with the world and to remind myself that every line of code is a step toward something greater.
